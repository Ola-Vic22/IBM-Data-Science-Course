    "### Objective\n",
    "The objective of this part of the Final Assignment is to analyze the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods, as you did in the previous part. The goal is to provide insights into how the sales of XYZAutomotives, a company specializing in automotive sales, were affected during times of recession.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final assignment, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate the **Dashboarding skills** you have acquired in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims\n",
    "This lab aims to assess your abilities in creating various visualizations using <u>Plotly and Dash</u>. As a data scientist, you have been given a task to prepare a report on your findings from Automobile Sales data analysis.\r\n",
    "You decided to develop a dashboard representing two main reports:\n",

    "* \n",
    "Recession Period Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE*: Year range is between 1980 and 2013.s\n"
